## Start the application

The `start.sh` bash script will download the needed packages, build the project, start the application in the background, and open the application in a new web page in the default browser. So from the project directory, run:

```bash
$ ./start.sh
```

## Stop the application

The `stop.sh` bash script will stop the application, remove all the images, and data used. From the project directory, run:

```bash
$ ./stop.sh
```
